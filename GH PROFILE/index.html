<h2>What do I love?</h2>
<p class="one">Cars: Check</p>

<p class="two">I have been in love with them from the day I started breathing. At least that's what I am told. But I am pretty sure about it. The above photo is my wallpaper though. So it might check out.</p>

	<p class="four">So that was taken during my last trip to London and it had freshly snowed. The beautiful landscape made me take a video, it's a great feat as I am not one who actively documents his travels. But I do love to travel and combine it with Roadtrips!! Ahh the fun of those is soemthing I can never leave behind. It is fun and adventure filled. I would have driven from India to here if I could.</p>

	<h3>What about India??</h3>
	<p class="three">So, I am from India and was born and brought up there. It is country that is probably a mystery to everyone, myself included! There is soo much to do, so much to explore and so much diversity over there that you can not just bundle it into one experience. A fun fact: I personally know about 15-20 Indians over here and can you believe that only 2 of them speak the language that I do. That's amazing and proposturous at the same time, but we do have more than 500 languages. So it does seem fair :) </p>

	<p class="five">So, if you are interested to know more or see more, feel free to find me and talk to me about it. I would even love to help you about places to visit if you do plan on going there someday. Happy Travels.</p>
